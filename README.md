# Real-Time AI Voice Sales Agent
Built with LiveKit + Cerebras LLaMA 3.3

A real-time, voice-enabled AI sales agent capable of natural, spoken conversations with customers.
This project goes beyond a traditional chatbot: the agent can listen, think, speak, and transfer conversations between specialized AI agents (Sales, Technical, Pricing) in real time.

The system is implemented in Google Colab using LiveKit Agents, Cerebras-hosted LLaMA 3.3 70B, and modern speech pipelines for STT, TTS, and voice activity detection.
